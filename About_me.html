					<p><strong>Martin Takac</strong> is an Associate Professor and the Deputy Department Chair of Machine Learning at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in the UAE. Prior to joining MBZUAI, he was an Associate Professor in the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at Lehigh University, where he had been on faculty since 2014. He earned his <strong>B.S.</strong> (2008) and <strong>M.S.</strong> (2010) degrees in Mathematics from Comenius University, Slovakia, and his <strong>Ph.D.</strong> (2014) in Mathematics from the University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Martin’s research focuses on the development and analysis of algorithms for <em>machine learning</em>, <em>AI-driven scientific discovery</em>, <em>protein-DNA interaction studies</em>, and the application of machine learning to <em>energy systems</em>. His work has earned him several prestigious awards, including the <strong>Best Ph.D. Dissertation Award</strong> by the <em>OR Society</em> (2014), the <strong>Leslie Fox Prize</strong> (2nd Prize; 2013) by the <em>Institute for Mathematics and its Applications</em>, the <strong>INFORMS Computing Society Best Student Paper Award</strong> (runner-up; 2012), and the <strong>Charles Broyden Prize</strong> for the best paper published in the 2022 volume of <em>Optimization Methods and Software</em>.</p>

<p>He has received funding from multiple <em>U.S. National Science Foundation</em> programs, including a <strong>TRIPODS Institute</strong> grant in collaboration with <em>Lehigh</em>, <em>Northwestern</em>, and <em>Boston University</em>. Recently, he was also awarded three grants in partnership with the <em>Weizmann Institute of Science</em>.</p>

<p>Martin has served as an <strong>Associate Editor</strong> for 
journals such as <em>Mathematical Programming Computation</em>, 
<em>Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications</em>, and 
<em>Optimization Methods and Software</em>. Additionally, he has taken 
on the role of <strong>Area Chair</strong> for top conferences such as 
<em>AISTATS</em>, <em>NeurIPS</em>, and <em>ICLR</em>, and served as a <strong>Senior Area Chair</strong> for <em>NeurIPS 2024</em>.</p>
